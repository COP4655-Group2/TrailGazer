Brainstorming 2
===

## Idea 1: CalorieTrack

**What:** App that allows you to track your daily calories, it allows people to have a more simpler way of tracking the food and energy they put in their bodies.

**Who:** The target audience for this app are people who want to take better care of their health through their diet. This includes people that are trying to lose weight as well as those that are trying to gain weight.

**Why:** Many of the apps that help you track your calories only let you input the calories themselves, by creating an app that only allows you to input the food and calculates the calories makes it easier for people who are just starting.

**Challenges:** The main challenge is that there are many apps that already help you track your calories, so the most important thing is to distinguish the app from others.


## Idea 2: LanguageLoom

**What:** App that helps connect people who are trying to learn a language with people who already know it, with the purpose of helping people learn the language by having others they can practive with.

**Who:** People who want to learn a new language.

**Why:** There are many apps that focus on the grammar and the words that are used, but at the end, the best way to fully understand a new language is by being able to use it, which is what our app will try to get people to do.

**Challenges:** The main challenges with this app are that we need to have a way to separate all of the people who want to learn different languages into  groups, so that they can try and contact those in their own group.


## Idea 3: MelodyMatch

**What:** A social media app that would allow people to connect with others who have a similar music tastes.

**Who:** People who want to find others that have similar music tastes and want to share the music they like with others.

**Why:** Provide people to connect with each other through music and form relationships based around their musical interests.

**Challenges:** Potential challenges are related to making a system that is able to correctly determine which people have similar music tastes and try to get them to connect.


## Idea 4: TrailGazer

**What:** An fitness app that is focused on running and hiking, it allows you to take pictures of the places you go to and put them on a map for you to remember and go at a later date.

**Who:** People who want to go out and observe the environment they are in.

**Why:** In order to get people who generally do little to no exercise out and do the minimum while also allowing them to explore.

**Challenges:** The main challenge is how to make the app attractive to our target audience in order to help them start going out more.


## Idea 5: Lost&Found

**What:** An app that creates a community that posts items that people have lost and help find their way back to those people.

**Who:** The app is meant for people who want to do something good for the community by giving back lost items

**Why:** Most of the time if something is lost it is very unlikely that people are going to find it again because the person who lost it is unknown. Which is something that can be fixed with an app that allows the person who lost the item to find it more easily.

**Challenges:** The biggest challenge would be to implement a system that would not allow people to claim items that are not theirs.
